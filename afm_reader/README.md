# afm_depth_reader
python script to read all .afm files in directory and outputs a csv file with the filename, pin, depth, and bottle closing time
afm_reader_OC2107A is a specific version of the script that is made for one specific naming scheme
afm_reader_default is a generic version that uses filename

## Getting Started
Download the Python script and make sure you have python installed.

### Prerequisites
I use anaconda3, however the script should be able to run using pip since the script uses only basic libraries.

### setup
The working directory must be the same folder you have the .afm files in so make sure you move into that directory before running the script.

### testing
I've attatched two example files for the program to read and output into a csv. Feel free to try if it works with the two test cnv files uploaded. I attached the output I get from this script using those two files as "out.csv", which the product of the default reader.

```

Enjoy!
