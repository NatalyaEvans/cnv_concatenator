# Project Title

This project is designed to save time reading btl files that log the hydro conditions when bottles were fired from Seabird into a single Excel sheet.

## Getting Started

Download the Python script and place it in a folder with the btl files that you want to read.
This script was built for a specific data process, so it is likely not as usable as the cnv_concatenator, but it might be helpful if you are willing to adapt it.

### Prerequisites

I used Spyder with Anaconda 3 as my Python viewer and engine.


### Installing

Once Seabird is downloaded and this file is in the correct folder, feel free to try if it works with the two test cnv files uploaded.
I attached the output I get from this script using those two files as "out.xlsx".


Happy concatenating!
