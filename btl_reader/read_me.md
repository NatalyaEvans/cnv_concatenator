# Project Title

This project is designed to save time reading btl files that log the hydro conditions when bottles were fired from Seabird into a single Excel sheet. It can also take averages of columns when processing for convenience

## Getting Started

Download the Python script and place it in a folder with the btl files that you want to read.

### Prerequisites

I used Spyder with Anaconda 3 as my Python viewer and engine.

### Installing

Once Seabird is downloaded and this file is in the correct folder, feel free to try if it works with the two test btl files uploaded.
I attached the output I get from this script using those two files as "out.csv".


Happy concatenating!
